    "The code iterates over a list of hidden factors (1 to 70) and applies Truncated SVD on the training set to calculate how much variance is captured by each number of components. This is crucial because in Matrix Factorization, we are attempting to obtain lower dimensionality with most important information. By summing up the ratio of explained variance for each number of components, we measure how well the model is at representing the data structure. We experimented with some approaches above, such as specifying a fixed given number of latent factors and attempting different imputation on missing values, but these methods did not have an objective criterion for choosing the appropriate factor number. Here, we compute rigorously the number of components with at least 90% of the cumulative variance, to strike a balance between keeping computational efficiency and preserving recommendation quality, and choose dynamically the optimal latent factor instead of using an arbitrary assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows the cumulative explained variance as we add more latent factors. Starting with a single factor, we capture only 3.28% of the variance, and it grows steadily with more factors. At 59 latent factors, the cumulative explained variance is 90.32%, so this is the number of components we need to retain at least 90% of the data's structure. This justifies the necessity of selecting an optimal latent factor—too few components will do a bad job of approximating the original user-item interactions, and too many components will lead to overfitting and unnecessary computation. This is an important step in ensuring that the recommendation system is accurate and efficient without being unnecessarily complex."

    "We start by invoking svd with n_components=59, i.e., we are factoring the original matrix into 59 significant latent factors that explain at least 90% of the data's variance. We next fit and transform train_matrix_sparse to obtain three principal components: U (user feature matrix), sigma (singular value diagonal matrix showing the significance of each latent factor), and Vt (transpose of item feature matrix). These will allow us to project users and items into a low-dimensional feature space without losing their relational information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we reconstruct the matrix by taking the product of U, sigma, and Vt and use this to estimate the initial user-item matrix. approximation_df, which contains the predicted ratings for each user-item pair. This reconstructed matrix is crucial in terms of generating recommendations since it allows us to make predictions for items that are not explicitly rated by the users. We use SVD instead of traditional memory-based techniques since it handles sparsity more effectively, does not have the cold-start issue, and it identifies inherent patterns in the users' preferences, and thus it is a strong technique in model-based collaborative filtering."

    "We validate our model by comparing predicted ratings from SVD approximation with the training set ratings. Since the form of the approximation matrix can be of a different nature, we transform it to the form of the training matrix before we pull out values from it. Precision of prediction is assessed in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). RMSE assigns more importance to big errors, while MAE provides us with an honest average absolute error. It informs us how well our model can reconstruct the original user-item matrix after dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Training RMSE of 0.1563 indicates that, on average, our estimates are off from true ratings by around 0.16 points, which is very low. The Training MAE of 0.0298 indicates that the average absolute error per estimate is around 0.03 points, which again confirms that the model is producing correct estimates. The low error values indicate that our SVD-based approach is doing a good job in identifying the latent factors and modeling user tastes appropriately without any overfitting."

    "The Testing RMSE of 0.2566 is little more than the Training RMSE of 0.1563, or that the model is slightly worse on new data. The Testing MAE of 0.0419 is likewise more than the Training MAE of 0.0298, an addition in absolute error by a bit. That can be expected given that the model has been fit to the training data but is predicting on novel information in the test set. That test error isn't much larger suggests that the model is generalizing extremely well and is not overfitting. Adding in small levels of error suggests that the model performs very high levels of accuracy in new user and food prediction. This suggests that SVD-based matrix factorization actually does a fantastic job when it comes to extracting patterns within sparse user-item data with extremely low prediction errors."

    "Here, we have a function which recommends the top 5 cuisines of the user based on the predicted ratings of the SVD model. First, we check if the user exists in the dataset in order to offer correct recommendations. Next, we use the original training matrix (train_matrix) to get the actual ratings submitted by the user and see what cuisines have already been rated by the user. We then retrieve SVD-predicted ratings from the reconstructed approximation matrix (approximation_df) and remove rated items so that only new, unseen cuisines are being recommended. We then select the top 5 cuisines with the highest predicted ratings, and we recover their names from the cuisine_data dataset. This ensures that the recommendation is consistent with the taste of the user while suggesting new cuisines that the user might like.\n",

    "The output shows that User 3 has previously rated seven different cuisines, including \"chicken tikka,\" \"hot chocolate,\" and \"steam bunny chicken bao.\" The recommendation model anticipates five new cuisines with high predicted ratings, including \"prawn fried rice,\" \"buldak (hot and spicy chicken),\" and \"crispy herb chicken.\" The diversity in recommendations shows that the model has been successful in discovering user preferences and is suggesting a mix of similar and diverse cuisines. However, other enhancements such as hybrid recommendations or fine-tuning per user may push the level of personalization further."
